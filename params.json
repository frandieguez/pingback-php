Please refer to its\r\n[original webpage](http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback) to get deeper information about how it works.\r\n\r\nA quick example:\r\n\r\nTo inform to [this article](http://www.mabishu.com/blog/2012/12/14/object-calisthenics-write-better-object-oriented-code/)\r\nthat you have referenced it from [one of your posts](http://www.mabishu.com/blog/2012/12/14/get-better-performance-and-life-from-your-ssd-in-linux-based-systems/)\r\nby using the Pingback protocol, you can make it like this:\r\n\r\n    // Prepare the Pingback client\r\n    $requestHandler = new Pingback\\RequestHandler();\r\n    $client = new Pingback\\Client($requestHandler);\r\n\r\n    // Perform the pingback call\r\n    try {\r\n\r\n        $client->ping(\r\n            \"http://www.mabishu.com/blog/2012/12/14/get-better-performance-and-life-from-your-ssd-in-linux-based-systems/\",\r\n            \"http://www.mabishu.com/blog/2012/12/14/object-calisthenics-write-better-object-oriented-code/\";\r\n        );\r\n\r\n    } catch (Pingback\\Exception $e) {\r\n      printf(\"Exception raised with code (%d) : %s\\n\", $e->getCode(), $e->getMessage());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nException-aware\r\n---------------\r\nPingback-PHP raises different exceptions if some error happens in the target server\r\nor between client-server communication.\r\n\r\nAll the exceptions has a direct correlation with the server reported faults:\r\n\r\n - 0: A generic fault code.\r\n - 0×0010 (16): The source URI does not exist.\r\n - 0×0011 (17): The source URI does not contain a link to the target URI\r\n - 0×0020 (32): The specified target URI does not exist.\r\n - 0×0021 (33): The specified target URI cannot be used as a target.\r\n - 0×0030 (48): The pingback has already been registered.\r\n - 0×0031 (49): Access denied.\r\n - 0×0032 (50): The server could not communicate with an upstream server.\r\n\r\nSo take care of this raised exceptions in your code.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall it!\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n1. Just put in one of your include_path folders, and make sure to use an\r\nPSR-0-compatible autoloader.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\nThis library only depends on PHP 5.3, you have to use namespaces and some other goodies of 5.3 version.\r\n\r\nPlease __don't ask for PHP < 5.3 support__, you shouldn't use PHP 5.2.\r\n\r\n\r\nTest it!\r\n--------\r\nHelp us to mantain this library updated. Run our unit tests with phpunit to\r\ngive us feedback about what doesn't work.\r\n\r\nFor running tests:\r\n\r\n1. Install in your system PHPUnit: http://pear.phpunit.de/\r\n4. And simply run phpunit from the root of projct: phpunit\r\n\r\nBuild Status\r\n------------\r\n[<img src=\"https://secure.travis-ci.org/frandieguez/pingback-php.png\"/>](http://travis-ci.org/frandieguez/pingback-php)\r\n\r\nAnd... what else?\r\n-----------------\r\nIf you find a bug or want to suggest a new video service, please let us know in [a ticket](http://github.com/frandieguez/pingback-php/issues).\r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n"}
